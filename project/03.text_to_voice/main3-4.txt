Elon Musk has sought to clarify how many Tesla workers will lose their jobs, following the launch of a lawsuit by former employees who claim the automaker breached U.S. labor laws.

Speaking at an event hosted by Bloomberg on Tuesday, Musk said Tesla would reduce its salaried workforce by 10% in the next three months, while at the same time growing the number of hourly employees.

A report earlier this month from Reuters said Musk wanted to cut 10% of jobs, citing an internal email penned by the Tesla CEO. In the memo, Musk reportedly said he has a “super bad feeling” about the economy.

But in a follow-up email to Tesla staff obtained by CNBC, Musk clarified the company will be reducing its salaried head count by 10% and increasing its hourly staffing.

Musk said Tuesday that this meant Tesla’s layoff announcement would affect around 3.5% of its overall workforce, adding the actual amount was “not super material.” Salaried workers account for about two-thirds of Tesla employees, he added.

“A year from now, I think our head count will be higher in both salaried and obviously in hourly,” Musk said.

On Sunday, two former Tesla employees filed a lawsuit against the company alleging it violated U.S. federal laws regarding “mass layoffs.”

Under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, employers are required to give 60 days advance notice of a mass layoff or plant closure.
