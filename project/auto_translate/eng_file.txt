America’s Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, 
the landmark ruling from 1973 that protected the right to an abortion. 
At least 25 states are expected to severely restrict or completely ban the practice, 
including, in some instances, in cases of rape or incest. 
It is the most consequential ruling by the Court in recent history, 
affecting tens of millions of women. 
President Joe Biden called the court’s decision a “tragic error”.
